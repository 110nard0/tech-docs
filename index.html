            <article>
                <p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can
                    recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state,
                    revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified
                    something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.
                </p>

                <p>The simplest and commonest method of version control entails copying files into another directory,
                    preferably a time-stamped one. However this is incredibly error-prone as it is easy to forget which
                    directory you are in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you do not mean to.
                    To deal with this issue, programmers have developed three different types of version control systems
                    (VCSs):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Local Version Control Systems:
                        These are simple databases on the host machine that keep all the changes to files under revision
                        control.
                    </li>
                    <li>Centralized Version Control Systems:
                        These systems have a single server that contains all the versioned files and a number of clients
                        that check out files from that central place. This setup offers increased collaboration and
                        transparency on projects. The most obvious downside to this setup is the single point of failure
                        which centralized databases represent.
                    </li>
                    <li>Distributed Version Control Systems:
                        In a DVCS, clients do not just check out the latest snapshot of files; rather they fully mirror
                        the repository, including its full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were
                        collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the
                        server to restore it as every clone is really a full backup of all the data.
                    </li>
                </ol>

        <section class="main-section" id="What_is_Git?">
            <header>What is Git?</header>
            <article>
                <p> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system originally developed in 2005 by
                    Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. Since its birth, Git has
                    evolved and matured to be fast, easy to use, very efficient with large projects, and with an
                    incredible branching system for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches).
                </p>

                <p>The major difference between Git and any other VCS is the way Git thinks about its data. These other
                    systems think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over
                    time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control). Git does not think of or store its
                    data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature
                    filesystem.
                </p>

                <p>With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, a picture of what all your files
                    look like at that moment and a reference to that snapshot is stored. To be efficient, if files have
                    not changed, Git does not store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has
                    already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots. This makes Git more like
                    a mini filesystem with some incredibly powerful tools built on top of it, rather than simply a VCS.
                </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Properties_of_Git">
            <header>Properties of Git</header>
            <article>
                <p>Git has some special features which make it seem blessed with ungodly powers. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Git Has Integrity:
                            Everything in Git is checksummed before it is stored and is then referred to by that
                            checksum. This means it is impossible to change the contents of any file or directory
                            without Git knowing about it. The mechanism that Git uses for this checksumming is called a
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1"> "SHA-1 hash"</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p> This is a 40-character string composed of hexadecimal characters (0–9 and a–f) and
                            calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in Git. A SHA-1 hash looks
                            something like this: <code class="inline">24b9da6552252987aa493b52f8696cd6d3b00373</code>.
                            You will see these hash values all over the place in Git because it uses them so much. In
                            fact, Git stores everything in its database not by file name but by the hash value of its
                            contents.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>Git Generally Only Adds Data:
                        When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. As with
                        any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you have not committed yet, but after you commit a
                        snapshot into Git, it is very difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database
                        to another repository.
                    </li>

                    <li>Nearly Every Operation Is Local:
                        Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate — generally no information
                        is needed from another computer on your network. Because you have the entire history of the
                        project right there on your local disk, most operations seem almost instantaneous. This means
                        you see the project history almost instantly and that there is very little you cannot do if you
                        are offline or off VPN.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="The_Three_States">
            <header>The Three States</header>
            <article class="shrink">
                <p>Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your
                        database yet.
                    </li>
                    <li>Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go
                        into your next commit snapshot.</li>
                    <li>Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.</li>
                </ul>

                <p> This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project: the working tree, the staging area, and
                    the Git directory.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files
                        are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use
                        or modify.
                    </li>
                    <li>The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that
                        stores information about what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in Git parlance
                        is the “index”, but the phrase “staging area” works just as well.</li>
                    <li>The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your
                        project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a
                        repository from another computer.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The basic Git workflow goes something like this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You modify files in your working tree.</li>
                    <li>You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit,
                        which adds only those changes to the staging area.</li>
                    <li>You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores
                        that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it is considered committed. If it has
                    been modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged. And if it was changed since it
                    was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Getting_a_Git_Repository">
            <header>Getting a Git Repository</header>
            <article>
                <p>You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory:
                        If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to
                        start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that project’s directory in the command
                        line and type:
                        <code>$ git init</code>
                        This creates a new subdirectory named <code class="inline">.git</code> that contains all of your
                        necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project
                        is tracked yet.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cloning an Existing Repository:
                        If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository — for example, a project you would like
                        to contribute to — the command you need is <code class="inline">git clone</code>. Every version
                        of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run this
                        command.
                        You clone a repository with <code class="inline">git clone /url/ </code>. For example, if you
                        want to clone the Git linkable library called <code class="inline">libgit2</code>, you can do so
                        like this:

                        <code>$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2</code>

                        <p>That creates a directory named <code class="inline">libgit2</code>, initializes a <code
                                class="inline">.git</code> directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that
                            repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new
                            <code class="inline">libgit2</code> directory that was just created, you will see the
                            project files in there, ready to be worked on or used.
                        </p>

                        <p>Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous example uses the
                            <code class="inline">https:// protocol</code>, but you may also see <code
                                class="inline">git://</code> or <code
                                class="inline">user@server:path/to/repo.git</code>, which uses the SSH transfer
                            protocol.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

        <section class="main-section" id="Checking_the_Status_of_Your_Files">
            <header>Checking the Status of Your Files</header>
            <article>
                <p>The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the <code
                        class="inline">git status</code> command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you
                    should see something like this:</p>

                <code>$ git status
                On branch main
                Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
                nothing to commit, working tree clean
                </code>

                <p>This means you have a clean working directory; in other words, none of your tracked files are
                    modified. Git also does not see any untracked files, or they would be listed here. Finally,
                    the command tells you which branch you are on and informs you that it has not diverged from the same
                    branch on the server.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Tracking_New_Files">
            <header>Tracking New Files</header>
            <article>
                <p>In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command <code class="inline">git add</code>. To
                    begin tracking the <code class="inline">README</code> file, you can run this:</p>
                <code>$ git add README</code>
                <p>If you run your status command again, you can see that your README file is now tracked and staged to
                    be committed. You can tell that it is staged because it is under the “Changes to be committed”
                    heading.</p>
                <p>If you commit at this point, the version of the file at the time you ran <code
                        class="inline">git add</code> is what will be in the subsequent historical snapshot. The <code
                        class="inline">git add</code> command takes a path name for either a file or a directory; if it
                    is a directory, the command adds all the files in that directory recursively.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Staging_Modified_Files">
            <header>Staging Modified Files</header>
            <article>
                <p>If you change an already tracked file called <code class="inline">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> and then run
                    your <code class="inline">git status</code> command again, the <code
                        class="inline">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file appears under a section named “Changes not staged for
                    commit” — which means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not
                    yet staged.</p>
                <p>To stage it, you run the <code class="inline">git add</code> command. <code
                        class="inline">git add</code> is a multipurpose command — you use it to begin tracking new
                    files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. Think
                    of it more as “add precisely this content to the next commit” rather than “add this file to the
                    project”. Run <code class="inline">git add</code> now to stage the <code
                        class="inline">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file, and then run <code class="inline">git status</code>
                    again:
                </p>

                <code>$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
                $ git status

            <article>
                <p>Now that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your changes. Remember that
                    anything that is still unstaged — any files you have created or modified that you have not staged
                    since you edited them — will not go into this commit. They will stay as modified files on your disk.
                </p>

                <p>In this case, let us say that everything was staged and you are ready to commit your changes. The
                    simplest way to commit is to type <code class="inline">git commit</code>. Doing so launches your
                    editor of choice where you can edit the commit message or use the default commit message provided.
                    Alternatively, you can type your commit message inline with the commit command by specifying it
                    after a -m flag, like this:
                </p>

                <code>$ git commit -m "Story 182: fix benchmarks for speed"

                <p>You have successfully created your first commit! You can see that the commit has given you some
                    output about itself: which branch you committed to (main), what SHA-1 checksum the commit has
                    (463dc4f), how many files were changed, and statistics about lines added and removed in the commit.
                    Every time you perform a commit, you are recording a snapshot of your project that you can revert to
                    or compare to later.

            <article>
                <p>When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the
                    content you staged. This object also contains the author’s name and email address, the message that
                    you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (its parent
                    or parents). If you make some changes and commit again, the next commit stores a pointer to the
                    commit that came immediately before it.</p>

                <p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. When you create a
                    new branch, a new pointer for you to move around is created. Let us assume you want to create a new
                    branch called "testing". You do this with the <code class="inline">git branch</code> command:</p>
                <code>$ git branch testing</code>
                <p>This creates a new pointer to the same commit you are currently on. Git knows what branch
                    you are currently on because it keeps a special pointer called <code class="inline">HEAD</code>
                    which points to the local branch you are currently on. In this case, you are still on <code
                        class="inline">main</code>. The <code class="inline">git branch</code> command only created a
                    new branch — it did not switch to that branch.</p>

                <p>To switch to an existing branch, you run the <code class="inline">git checkout</code> command. Let us
                    switch to the new testing branch:</p>
                <code>$ git checkout testing</code>
                <p>This moves <code class="inline">HEAD</code> to point to the <code

                    the new <code class="inline">testing</code> branch.</p>
                <p>From Git version 2.23 onwards you can use <code class="inline">git switch</code> instead of

            <header>Basic Merging</header>
            <article>
                <p>Assuming that after creating the new <code class="inline">testing</code> branch, you work on
                    your website and make some commits. Doing so moves the <code class="inline">testing</code> branch
                    forward, because you have it checked out (that is, your <code class="inline">HEAD</code> is pointing
                    to it).</p>
                <p>Along the line, you want to incorporate urgent fixes to the project. With Git, you do not have to
                    deploy your fix along with the testing changes you have made, and you dot nohave to put a lot of
                    effort into reverting those changes before you can work on applying your fix to what is in
                    production. All you have to do is switch back to your <code class="inline">main</code> branch.</p>
                <p>However, before you do that, note that if your working directory or staging area has uncommitted
                    changes that conflict with the branch you are checking out, Git will not let you switch branches.
                    It is best to have a clean working state when you switch branches. There are ways to get around this
                    but for now, let us assume you have committed all your changes, so you can switch back to your <code
                        class="inline">main</code> branch:</p>

                <code>$ git checkout main
                Switched to branch 'main'
                </code>

                <p>At this point, your project working directory is exactly the way it was before you started working on
                    <code class="inline">testing</code>, and you can concentrate on your hotfix. When you switch
                    branches, Git resets your working directory to look like it did the last time you committed on that
                    branch. It adds, removes, and modifies files automatically to make sure your working copy is what
                    the branch looked like on your last commit to it. Create a <code class="inline">hotfix</code>
                    branch on which to work until it is completed:
                </p>

                <code>$ git checkout -b hotfix
                Switched to a new branch "hotfix"
                </code>

                <p> You can make your changes, make sure the fixes are exactly how you want, and finally merge the
                    <code class="inline">hotfix</code> branch back into your <code class="inline">main</code> branch
                    to deploy to production. You do this with the <code class="inline">git merge</code> command:
                </p>

                <code>$ git checkout main
                $ git merge hotfix
                Updating f42c576..3a0874c
                Fast-forward
                  index.html | 2 ++
                  1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
                </code>

                <p>You will notice the phrase “fast-forward” in that merge. Because the commit pointed to by the branch
                    <code class="inline">hotfix</code> you merged in was directly ahead of the commit you are on, Git
                    simply moves the pointer forward. Your change is now in the snapshot of the commit pointed to by the
                    main branch, and you can deploy the fix.
                </p>
                <p>After your fix is deployed, you are ready to switch back to the work you were doing before you were
                    interrupted. However, first delete the <code class="inline">hotfix</code> branch, because you no
                    longer need it — the <code class="inline"> main</code> branch points at the same place. You can
                    delete it with the -d option to <code class="inline">git branch</code>:
                </p>

                <code>$ git branch -d hotfix
                Deleted branch hotfix (3a0874c).
                </code>

                <p>Now you can switch back to your work-in-progress branch on <code class="inline">testing</code> and
                    continue working on it. It is worth noting here that the work you did in your <code
                        class="inline">hotfix</code> branch is not contained in the files in your <code
                        class="inline">testing</code> branch.</p>
                <p>Suppose you have decided that the testing work is complete and ready to be merged into your <class
                        class="inline">main</class> branch. In order to do that, merge your <code
                        class="inline">testing</code> branch into <code class="inline">main</code>, much like you merged
                    your <code class="inline">hotfix</code> branch earlier. All you have to do is check out the branch
                    you wish to merge into and then run the <code class="inline">git merge</code> command:</p>

                <code>$ git checkout main
                Switched to branch 'main'
                $ git merge testing
                Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
                index.html | 1 +
                1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
                </code>

                <p>This looks a bit different than the <code class="inline">hotfix</code> merge you did earlier. In this
                    case, your development history has diverged from some older point. Because the commit on the branch
                    you are on is not a direct ancestor of the branch you are merging in, Git has to do some work. In
                    this case, Git does a simple three-way merge, using the two snapshots pointed to by the branch tips
                    and the common ancestor of the two.
                </p>
                <p>Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot that results from this
                    three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it. This is referred to as a
                    merge commit, and is special in that it has more than one parent. Now that your work is merged in,
                    you have no further need for the <code class="inline">testing</code> branch. You can close the issue
                    in your issue-tracking system, and delete the branch as shown earlier.</p>

            <article>
                <p>To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how to manage your remote
                    repositories. Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or
                    a network somewhere. To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the
                    <code class="inline">git remote</code> command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you
                    have specified.
                </p>
                <p>If you have cloned your repository, you should at least see <code class="inline">origin</code> — that
                    is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from. We have given some demonstrations of
                    how the <code class="inline">git clone</code> command implicitly adds the <code
                        class="inline">origin</code> remote for you. To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname
                    you can reference easily, run <code class="inline">git remote add /shortname/ /url/:</code></p>

                <code>$ git remote
                origin
                $ git remote add doc https://github.com/110nard0/tech-docs.git
                </code>

                <p>Now you can use the string "doc" on the command line in lieu of the whole URL.</p>

            <header>Fetching and Pulling from Remotes</header>
            <article>
                <p>As you just saw, to get data from your remote projects, you can run:</p>
                <code>$ git fetch /remote/</code>
                <p>The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that
                    you do not have yet. After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that
                    remote, which you can merge in or inspect at any time. Note that the <code
                        class="inline">git fetch</code> command only downloads the data to your local repository — it
                    does not automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you are currently working on.
                    You have to merge it manually into your work when you are ready.</p>
                <p>If your current branch is set up to track a remote branch, you can use the <code
                        class="inline">git pull</code> command to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch
                    into your current branch. This may be an easier or more comfortable workflow for you; and by
                    default, the <code class="inline">git clone</code> command automatically sets up your local <code
                        class="inline">main</code> branch to track the remote <code class="inline">main</code> branch
                    (or whatever the default branch is called) on the server you cloned from. Running
                    <code class="inline">git pull</code> generally fetches data from the server you originally cloned
                    from and automatically tries to merge it into the code you are currently working on.

            <article>
                <p>When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream. The
                    command for this is simple: <code class="inline">git push /remote/ /branch/</code>. If you want to
                    push your <code class="inline">main</code> branch to your <code class="inline">origin</code> server
                    (again, cloning generally sets up both of those names for you automatically), then you can run this
                    to push any commits you have done back up to the server:</p>
                <code>$ git push origin main</code>
                <p>This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write access and if nobody has
                    pushed in the meantime. If you and someone else clone at the same time and they push upstream and
                    then you push upstream, your push will rightly be rejected. You will have to fetch their work first
                    and incorporate it into yours before you woild be allowed to push.</p>
