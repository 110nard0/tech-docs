            <article>
                <p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can
                    recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state,
                    revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified
                    something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.
                </p>

                <p>There are three main types of version control systems (VCS):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Local Version Control Systems:
                        The simplest and commonest method of version control entails copying files into another
                        directory, preferably a time-stamped one. However this is incredibly error-prone as it is easy
                        to forget which directory you are in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files
                        you do not mean to. To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had
                        a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.
                    </li>
                    <li>Centralized Version Control Systems:
                        These systems have a single server that contains all the versioned files and a number of clients
                        that check out files from that central place. This setup offers many advantages over local VCSs
                        including collaboration and transparency. Administrators also have more control over permissions
                        and it is far easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every
                        client. The most obvious downside to this setup is the single point of failure that centralized
                        databases represent.
                    </li>
                    <li>Distributed Version Control Systems:
                        In a DVCS, clients don't just check out the latest snapshot of files; rather they fully mirror
                        the repository, including its full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were
                        collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the
                        server to restore it as every clone is really a full backup of all the data.
                        Furthermore, many of these systems deal pretty well with having several remote repositories they
                        can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways
                        simultaneously within the same project.
                    </li>
                </ol>

        <section class="main-section" id="What_is_Git?">
            <header>What is Git?</header>
            <article>
                <p> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system originally developed in 2005 by
                    Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. Since its birth, Git has
                    evolved and matured to be fast, easy to use, very efficient with large projects, and with an
                    incredible branching system for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches).
                </p>

                <p>The major difference between Git and any other VCS is the way Git thinks about its data.
                    Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These other
                    systems think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over
                    time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).
                    Git does not think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series
                    of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your
                    project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a
                    reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git does not store the file
                    again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data
                    more like a stream of snapshots. This makes Git more like a mini filesystem with some incredibly
                    powerful tools built on top of it, rather than simply a VCS.

        <section class="main-section" id="Properties_of_Git">
            <header>Properties of Git</header>
            <article>
                <p>Git has some special features which make it seem blessed with ungodly powers. These include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Git Has Integrity:
                            Everything in Git is checksummed before it is stored and is then referred to by that
                            checksum. This means it is impossible to change the contents of any file or directory
                            without Git knowing about it. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and
                            is integral to its philosophy. You cannot lose information in transit or get file corruption
                            without Git being able to detect it.
                            The mechanism that Git uses for this checksumming is called a
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1"> "SHA-1 hash"</a>. This is a 40-character
                            string composed of hexadecimal characters (0–9 and a–f) and calculated based on the contents
                            of a file or directory structure in Git. A SHA-1 hash looks something like this:
                        </p>
                        <pre>24b9da6552252987aa493b52f8696cd6d3b00373</pre>
                        <p>You will see these hash values all over the place in Git because it uses them so much. In
                            fact, Git stores everything in its database not by file name but by the hash value of its
                            contents.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>Git Generally Only Adds Data:
                        When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. It is hard to
                        get the system to do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way. As with
                        any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you have not committed yet, but after you commit a
                        snapshot into Git, it is very difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database
                        to another repository. This makes using Git a joy because we know we can experiment without the
                        danger of severely screwing things up.
                    </li>

                    <li>Nearly Every Operation Is Local:
                        Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate — generally no information
                        is needed from another computer on your network. Because you have the entire history of the
                        project right there on your local disk, most operations seem almost instantaneous.
                        This means you see the project history almost instantly. This also means that there is very
                        little you cannot do if you are offline or off VPN.
                    </li>

        <section class="main-section" id="The_Three_States">
            <header>The Three States</header>
            <article class="none">
                <p>Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
                    </li>
                    <li>Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next
                        commit snapshot.</li>
                    <li>Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.</li>
                </ul>

                <p> This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project: the working tree, the staging area, and
                    the Git directory.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out
                        of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
                    </li>
                    <li>The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information
                        about what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in Git parlance is the “index”,
                        but the phrase “staging area” works just as well.</li>
                    <li>The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is
                        the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from
                        another computer.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The basic Git workflow goes something like this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You modify files in your working tree.</li>
                    <li>You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds
                        only those changes to the staging area.</li>
                    <li>You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot
                        permanently to your Git directory.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it is considered committed. If it has
                    been modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged. And if it was changed since it
                    was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Getting_a_Git_Repository">
            <header>Getting a Git Repository</header>
            <article>
                <p>You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory:
                        If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to
                        start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that project’s directory in the command
                        line and type:

                        <pre>$ git init</pre>

                        This creates a new subdirectory named <code>.git</code> that contains all of your necessary
                        repository files — a Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked
                        yet.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cloning an Existing Repository:
                        If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository — for example, a project you would like
                        to contribute to — the command you need is <code>git clone</code>. Every version of every file
                        for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run this command.
                        You clone a repository with <code>git clone (url) </code> . For example, if you want to clone
                        the Git linkable library called <code>libgit2</code>, you can do so like this:

                        <pre>$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2</pre>

                        That creates a directory named <code>libgit2</code>, initializes a <code>.git</code> directory
                        inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the
                        latest version. If you go into the new <code>libgit2</code> directory that was just created,
                        you will see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used.
                        If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than
                        <code>libgit2</code>, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument:

                        <pre>$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit</pre>

                        That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called
                        <code>mylibgit</code>.
                        Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous example uses the
                        <code>https:// protocol</code>, but you may also see <code>git://</code> or
                        <code>user@server:path/to/repo.git</code>, which uses the SSH transfer protocol.
                    </li>

            <header>Checking the Status of Your Files</header>
            <article>
                <p>The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the <code>git status</code>
                    command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:</p>

                <pre>
                <code>$ git status
                On branch main
                Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
                nothing to commit, working tree clean</code>
                </pre>

                <p>This means you have a clean working directory; in other words, none of your tracked files are
                    modified. Git also does not see any untracked files, or they would be listed here. Finally,
                    the command tells you which branch you are on and informs you that it has not diverged from the same
                    branch on the server.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Tracking_New_Files">
            <header>Tracking New Files</header>
            <article>
                <p>In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command <code>git add</code>. To begin tracking
                    the README file, you can run this:</p>
                <pre>$ git add README</pre>
                <p>If you run your status command again, you can see that your README file is now tracked and staged to
                    be committed:</p>

                <pre>
                <code>$ git status
                On branch main
                Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
                Changes to be committed:
                  (use "git restore --staged /file/..." to unstage)
                    new file: README</code>
                </pre>

                <p>You can tell that it is staged because it is under the “Changes to be committed” heading. If you
                    commit at this point, the version of the file at the time you ran <code>git add</code> is what will
                    be in the subsequent historical snapshot. The <code>git add</code> command takes a path name for
                    either a file or a directory; if it Is a directory, the command adds all the files in that directory
                    recursively.</p>

                    “Changes not staged for commit” — which means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the
                    working directory but not yet staged. To stage it, you run the <code>git add</code> command.
                    <code>git add</code> is a multipurpose command — you use it to begin tracking new files, to stage
                    files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. It may be helpful to
                    think of it more as “add precisely this content to the next commit” rather than “add this file to
                    the project”. Let’s run <code>git add</code> now to stage the CONTRIBUTING.md file, and then run
                    <code>git status</code> again:
                </p>

                <pre>
                <code>$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
                $ git status
                On branch main
                Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
                Changes to be committed:
                  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
                    new file: README
                      modified: CONTRIBUTING.md</code>
                </pre>

                <P>Both files are staged and will go into your next commit.</P>

            <header>Committing Your Changes</header>
            <article>
                <p>Now that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your changes. Remember that
                    anything that is still unstaged — any files you have created or modified that you haven’t run
                    <code>git add</code> on since you edited them — won’t go into this commit. They will stay as
                    modified files on your disk. In this case, let’s say that the last time you ran
                    <code>git status</code>, you saw that everything was staged, so you’re ready to commit
                    your changes. The simplest way to commit is to type <code>git commit</code>. Doing so launches your
                    editor of choice where you can edit the commit message or use the default commit message provided.
                    Alternatively, you can type your commit message inline with the commit command by specifying it
                    after a -m flag, like this:
                </p>

                <pre>
                <code>$ git commit -m "Story 182: fix benchmarks for speed"
                  [main 463dc4f] Story 182: fix benchmarks for speed
                    2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
                    create mode 100644 README
                </code>
                </pre>

                <p>Now you’ve created your first commit! You can see that the commit has given you some output about
                    itself: which branch you committed to (main), what SHA-1 checksum the commit has (463dc4f), how many
                    files were changed, and statistics about lines added and removed in the commit. Remember that the
                    commit records the snapshot you set up in your staging area. Anything you didn’t stage is still
                    sitting there modified; you can do another commit to add it to your history. Every time you perform
                    a commit, you’re recording a snapshot of your project that you can revert to or compare to later.

            <header>Creating Branches</header>
            <article>
                <p>When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the
                    content you staged. This object also contains the author’s name and email address, the message that
                    you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (its parent
                    or parents). If you make some changes and commit again, the next commit stores a pointer to the
                    commit that came immediately before it. A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to
                    one of these commits.</p>

                <p>What happens when you create a new branch? Well, doing so creates a new pointer for you to move
                    around. Let’s say you want to create a new branch called "testing". You do this
                    with the <code>git branch</code> command:</p>
                <pre>$ git branch testing</pre>
                <p>This creates a new pointer to the same commit you’re currently on. How does Git know what branch
                    you’re currently on? It keeps a special pointer called HEAD which pointsd to the local branch
                    you’re currently on. In this case, you’re still on <code>main</code>. The git branch command only
                    created a new branch — it didn’t switch to that branch.</p>

            <header>Switching Between Branches</header>
            <article>
                <p>To switch to an existing branch, you run the <code>git checkout</code> command. Let’s switch to the
                    new testing branch:</p>
                <pre>$ git checkout testing</pre>
                <p>This moves HEAD to point to the <code>testing branch</code>. Any commits made from this point onwards
                    will be made from the new <code>testing</code> branch.</p>
                <p>From Git version 2.23 onwards you can use <code>git switch</code> instead of
                    <code>git checkout</code> to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Switch to an existing branch: <code>git switch testing-branch</code>.</li>
                    <li>Create a new branch and switch to it: <code>git switch -c new-branch</code>.
                        The <code>-c</code> flag stands for create, you can also use the full flag:
                        <code>--create</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Return to your previously checked out branch: <code>git switch -</code>.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Merging">
            <header>Basic Merging</header>
            <article>
                <p>Let's assume that after creating the new <code>testing</code> branch, you work on your website and
                    make some commits. Doing so moves the <code>testing</code> branch forward, because you have it
                    checked out (that is, your <code>HEAD</code> is pointing to it). Along the line, you want to
                    incorporate urgent fixes to the project.With Git, you don’t have to deploy your fix along with the
                    testing changes you’ve made, and you don’t have to put a lot of effort into reverting those changes
                    before you can work on applying your fix to what is in production. All you have to do is switch back
                    to your main branch.</p>

                <p>However, before you do that, note that if your working directory or staging area has uncommitted
                    changes that conflict with the branch you’re checking out, Git won’t let you switch branches. It’s
                    best to have a clean working state when you switch branches. There are ways to get around this but
                    for now, let’s assume you’ve committed all your changes, so you can switch back to your main
                    branch:</p>

                <pre>
                <code>$ git checkout main
                Switched to branch 'main'
                </code>
                </pre>

                <p>At this point, your project working directory is exactly the way it was before you started working on
                    <code>testing</code>, and you can concentrate on your hotfix. When you switch branches, Git resets
                    your working directory to look like it did the last time you committed on that branch. It adds,
                    removes, and modifies files automatically to make sure your working copy is what the branch looked
                    like on your last commit to it. Let’s create a hotfix branch on which to work until it’s completed:
                </p>

                <pre>
                <code>$ git checkout -b hotfix
                Switched to a new branch "hotfix"
                </code>
                </pre>

                <p> You can make your changes, make sure the hotfix is what you want, and finally merge the hotfix
                    branch back into your main branch to deploy to production. You do this with the
                    <code>git merge</code> command:
                </p>

                <pre>
                <code>$ git checkout main
                $ git merge hotfix
                Updating f42c576..3a0874c
                Fast-forward
                  index.html | 2 ++
                  1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
                </code>
                </pre>

                <p>You’ll notice the phrase “fast-forward” in that merge. Because the commit pointed to by the branch
                    <code>hotfix</code> you merged in was directly ahead of the commit you’re on, Git simply moves the
                    pointer forward. Your change is now in the snapshot of the commit pointed to by the main branch, and
                    you can deploy the fix. After your super-important fix is deployed, you’re ready to switch back to
                    the work you were doing before you were interrupted. However, first you’ll delete the hotfix branch,
                    because you no longer need it — the master branch points at the same place. You can delete it with
                    the -d option to <code>git branch</code>:
                </p>

                <pre>
                <code>$ git branch -d hotfix
                Deleted branch hotfix (3a0874c).
                </code></pre>

                <p>Now you can switch back to your work-in-progress branch on <code>testing</code> and continue working
                    on it. It’s worth noting here that the work you did in your hotfix branch is not contained in the
                    files in your testing branch. Suppose you’ve decided that testing work is complete and ready to be
                    merged into your main branch. In order to do that, you’ll merge your testing branch into main, much
                    like you merged your hotfix branch earlier. All you have to do is check out the branch you wish to
                    merge into and then run the git merge command:</p>

                <pre>
                <code>$ git checkout main
                Switched to branch 'main'
                $ git merge testing
                Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
                index.html | 1 +
                1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
                </code>
                </pre>

                <p>This looks a bit different than the hotfix merge you did earlier. In this case, your development
                    history has diverged from some older point. Because the commit on the branch you’re on isn’t a
                    direct ancestor of the branch you’re merging in, Git has to do some work. In this case, Git does a
                    simple three-way merge, using the two snapshots pointed to by the branch tips and the common
                    ancestor of the two. Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot
                    that results from this three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it.
                    This is referred to as a merge commit, and is special in that it has more than one parent.
                    Now that your work is merged in, you have no further need for the testing branch. You can close the
                    issue in your issue-tracking system, and delete the branch as shown earlier.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Adding_Remote_Respositories">
            <header>Adding Remote Respositories</header>
            <article>
                <p>To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how to manage your remote
                    repositories. Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the
                    Internet or network somewhere. To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run
                    the <code>git remote</code> command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified.
                    If you’ve cloned your repository, you should at least see <code>origin</code> — that is the default
                    name Git gives to the server you cloned from.
                </p>
                <p>We’ve mentioned and given some demonstrations of how the <code>git clone</code> command implicitly
                    adds the <code>origin</code> remote for you.To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you
                    can reference easily, run git remote add /shortname/ /url/:</p>

                <pre>
                <code>$ git remote
                origin
                $ git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit</code>
                </pre>

                <p>Now you can use the string "pb" on the command line in lieu of the whole URL. For example, if you
                    want to fetch all the information that Paul has but that you don’t yet have in your repository, you
                    can run git fetch pb :</p>

                <pre>
                <code>$ git fetch pb
                remote: Counting objects: 43, done.
                remote: Compressing objects: 100% (36/36), done.
                remote: Total 43 (delta 10), reused 31 (delta 5)
                Unpacking objects: 100% (43/43), done.
                From https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
                * [new branch] main -> pb/main
                * [new branch] ticgit -> pb/ticgit
                </code>
                </pre>

                <p>Paul’s <code>main branch</code> is now accessible locally as <code>pb/origin</code>  — you can merge
                    it into one of your branches, or you can check out a local branch at that point if you want to
                    inspect it.</p>

            <header>Fetching and Pulling from Remotes</header>
            <article>
                <p>As you just saw, to get data from your remote projects, you can run:</p>
                <pre>$ git fetch /remote/</pre>
                <p>The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that
                    you don’t have yet. After you do this, you should have references to all the
                    branches from that remote, which you can merge in or inspect at any time.
                    It is important to note that the <code>git fetch</code> command only downloads the data to your
                    local repository — it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re
                    currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.</p>
                <p>If your current branch is set up to track a remote branch, you can use the <code>git pull</code>
                    command to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch into your current branch. This may
                    be an easier or more comfortable workflow for you; and by default, the <code>git clone</code>
                    command automatically sets up your local main branch to track the remote main branch (or whatever
                    the default branch is called) on the server you cloned from. Running <code>git pull</code> generally
                    fetches data from the server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the
                    code you’re currently working on.</p>

            <article>
                <p>When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream. The
                    command for this is simple: <code>git push /remote/ /branch/</code>. If you want to push your maIN
                    branch to your origin server (again, cloning generally sets up both of those names for you
                    automatically), then you can run this to push any commits you’ve done back up to the server:</p>
                <pre>$ git push origin main</pre>
                <p>This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write access and if nobody has
                    pushed in the meantime. If you and someone else clone at the same time and they push upstream and
                    then you push upstream, your push will rightly be rejected. You’ll have to fetch their work first
                    and incorporate it into yours before you’ll be allowed to push.</p>
